## Sleep Quality Prediction Model

### Project Summary: 

#### Problem: 
Poor sleep quality is an ongoing issue in the United States and the world. Studies on sleep quality haven't been as prevalent and results aren't consistent enough to support actions. Over 40% of adults globally mentioned and decline in sleep quality over the past five years. Understanding that this issue isn't exclusive to a certain group and needs immediate attention to improve the quality of sleep of people is critical.

#### Data: 
The data we acquired is from Kaggle and is called the Sleep Health and Lifestyle Dataset. It consists of 374 observations and 13 initial attributes. The data holds a CC0 Public Domain license, which means it doesn't have a copyright and can be used for any purpose without permission. This is the link to the dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uom190346a/sleep-health-and-lifestyle-dataset


#### Goal: 
Through this project, we aim to identify, which attributes have created a significant impact on the quality of sleep from the above dataset. We also intend to determine, how to use machine learning to effectively predict sleep quality, and which models optimally perform. Lastly, our purpose is to decipher what practices can be harnessed in the real world to improve sleep quality based on our project

#### Methods:
We first conducted preprocessing by removing duplicates and null values as well as generated basic statistics to understand the data. Then we practiced exploratory analysis and used bar graphs and correlation matrices to visualize our results. This aided in finalizing columns and approaching machine learning models. We used a K-Nearest Neighbors model and an MLP model to predict sleep quality and evaluated them with a confusion matrix and classification report. We also created LIME samples to better understand the inherent black-box nature of such models. These processes allowed us to decipher the best models, and attributes and understand their application.
